This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.31.

## Issues
1: `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource` on local server <br/ > <br/ >
Solution: Download a CORS Extension for your browser
For chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-toggle/omcncfnpmcabckcddookmnajignpffnh?hl=en/
However if you uploaded the web-application to a server, this issue will not persist


## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
